# Panoramix
The purpose of this project was to study examples of thread and mutex programming and the algorithmic  
the difficulties that go with it.  
To do this, you must create a program that simulates the behavior described.  

The program had to follow certain rules:  
• Use of semaphores or mutexes  
• Each villager (and druid) have their own thread  
• The pot is full at the start of the program  
• A villager's thread must end when all battles have been completed  
• Druid's Thread must stop when it runs out of ingredients
